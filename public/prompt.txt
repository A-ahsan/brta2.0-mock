You are an expert full-stack product designer and frontend engineer.

I want you to create mockup UI components only (no backend logic yet) for my project called BRTA 2.O – Smart Transport Portal of Bangladesh.

Goal: to showcase a professional animated prototype of the website to clients and judges.  
Design should feel modern, government-grade, but startup-polished, with clean layout, icons, and motion transitions.
